Trying new data engineering tools can be difficult because we need a problem to
apply them to. Finding a problem of the right size is difficult - they can be
either too small and not interesting or too large and don't get completed.

But we do need to invent some toy-problems to experiment with new
technologies... So this is my reusable toy-problem that runs entirely locally.
