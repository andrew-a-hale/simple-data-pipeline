- Starting data projects is hard
  - They too small or too big
  - A lot of the time the tools we use cost money
- Should I do a certification or a project?
  - Is Data Engineering fun?
  - For Employability?
- What is fun?

Trying new data engineering tools can be difficult because they are either too
small and not interesting or too large and don't get completed. The

complex environments and spending time on toy-problems loses interest fast.

But we do need to invent some toy-problems to learn and play with new
technologies... So this is my reusable toy-problem that runs entirely locally.
